# Project Name: Project Employement Joel Dot. Net Applications

## Description
This project comprises three main components: a Windows desktop application in C#, an ASP.NET MVC web project, and calling a C++ DLL from a C# console application. Each component has its own set of tasks and implementation steps.

## Windows Desktop Application (C#)

**Task Description:**
Create a Windows desktop application in C# that performs prime number calculations and displays the results in a listbox.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **User Interface Design:**
   - Create a Windows Forms Application.
   - Design the application with two textboxes (for input), two buttons (for calculation), and a listbox (for displaying results).

2. **Prime Number Calculation Function:**
   - Implement a function to find prime numbers up to the input number. You can use standard algorithms for this (e.g., trial division).

3. **Multithreading:**
   - Use threading to perform calculations in separate threads to prevent the application from freezing during computation.
   - Implement thread management to create and manage threads for calculation.

4. **Updating the Listbox:**
   - Update the listbox with the results from each thread.
   - Ensure that the UI is updated properly when each thread completes its calculation.

## ASP.NET MVC Web Project

**Task Description:**
Create an ASP.NET MVC web project with two main features: linking to an entity (presumably a database) and a web service.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Set Up ASP.NET MVC Project:**
   - Create a new ASP.NET MVC project.

2. **Navigation Menu:**
   - Add a left-side navigation menu for easy access to different sections of the application.

3. **Link Entity Section:**
   - Create views for adding, deleting, and listing records.
   - Use Entity Framework to interact with a SQL Server or PostgreSQL database.

4. **Record Add Functionality:**
   - Implement a screen where users can enter name, surname, and age information.
   - Use Entity Framework to insert this data into the database.

5. **Record Delete Functionality:**
   - Implement a screen where users can enter the name to be deleted, and then delete the corresponding record from the database.

6. **Record List Functionality:**
   - List records from the database in the "Record List" view. Fetch data using Entity Framework and display it on the web page.

7. **Web Service (if applicable):**
   - Create a controller for the web service.
   - Define the API endpoints and methods for the web service.

## Calling C++ DLL from C# Console Application

**Task Description:**
Create a C++ DLL with a function that takes two integers as input and performs calculations. Create a C# console application that calls this DLL.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Create C++ DLL:**
   - Write the C++ code for the DLL that includes a function to perform calculations on two integers.

2. **Build and Compile DLL:**
   - Build and compile the C++ DLL to produce a DLL file that can be used in other applications.

3. **Create C# Console Application:**
   - Create a new C# console application in Visual Studio or my preferred development environment.

4. **Import the C++ DLL:**
   - Import the C++ DLL as a reference in my C# project.

5. **Call DLL Functions:**
   - Call the functions from the C++ DLL in your C# application. Pass two integer values as input parameters.

6. **Display Results:**
   - Display the results returned by the C++ DLL on the console screen.

These step-by-step instructions that  help me work through each component of the project. I was  sure to test and debug at each stage to ensure everything is working as expected.
